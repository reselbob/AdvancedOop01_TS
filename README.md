# Advanced OOP in TypeScript Part 1
A project that describes some advanced object oriented programming techniques using TypeScript

The purpose of this project is to provide an example of how to use TypeScript to interfaces and abstract classes to create a flexible and extensible object oriented design.

# Bonus projects

There are two bonus applications in the project. They are:

The **Communication** project in `communication` branch.

This project demonstrates how to use TypeScript to create a simple messaging system using interfaces and abstract classes.

To go to the **Communication** branch, run the following command:

```bash
git checkout communication
```

---

The **Commerce** project in the `commerce` branch.

This project demonstrates how to use TypeScript to create a simple shopping system using interfaces and abstract classes.

To go to the **Commerce** branch, run the following command:

```bash
git checkout commerce
```
